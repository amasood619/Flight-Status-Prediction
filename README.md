# Flight-Status-Prediction

I built an interactive Tableau dashboard using U.S. flight data to analyze airline reliability. I created calculated fields to classify flights as on-time versus delayed or cancelled, calculated average arrival delay minutes, and compared airlines using delay and cancellation rates. The dashboard lets users filter by airline, month, and departure time to identify high-risk carriers and time blocks based on historical patterns.”
